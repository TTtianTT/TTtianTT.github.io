I am currently a second-year Master's student at Peking University, under the guidance of [Professor Houfeng Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=YCX4y1gAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). My research interests lie in large language models and reinforcement learning.

I completed my undergraduate studies at the School of Computer Science, Wuhan University, from March 2019 to June 2022. Before that, I studied at the School of Urban Design at the same university from September 2018 to March 2019.

In terms of professional experience, I have interned at two renowned organizations. From April to July 2023, I interned at Zhihu, China, where I was involved in evaluating the mathematics, common sense, and reasoning capabilities of large language models.

Currently, from August 2023 to September 2024, I am interning at Microsoft in the [Data Knowledge and Intelligence Group (DKI)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/data-knowledge-intelligence/) in Beijing. Here, I am focusing on fine-tuning large language models for specific tasks on tabular data.
