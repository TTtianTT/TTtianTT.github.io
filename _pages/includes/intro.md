I am currently a second-year Master's student at Peking University, under the guidance of [Professor Houfeng Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=YCX4y1gAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). My research interests lie in large language models (LLMs), natural language processing (NLP), and graph neural networks (GNNs).

My academic journey began at Wuhan University, where I excelled in Computer Science and Technology. I completed my undergraduate studies at the School of Computer Science, Wuhan University, from 03/2019 to 06/2022, after transitioning from the School of Urban Design at the same university from 09/2018 to 03/2019.

During my master's program at Peking University, I worked on advanced NLP techniques, starting with Emotion Cause Analysis (ECA). Inspired by the potential of pre-trained language models and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), I proposed a novel approach that led to state-of-the-art performance in ECA. Following my success in ECA, I became increasingly aware of the critical need for robust fact-checking mechanisms. Motivated by the urgent need to combat misinformation, our team developed an evidence-based fact-checking model.

In addition to my academic achievements, I have gained valuable industry experience. From 04/2023 to 07/2023, I interned at Zhihu, China, where I assessed the mathematics, common sense, and reasoning capabilities of large language models. From 08/2023 to 10/2024, I interned at [Microsoft Research Asia's (MSRA) Data, Knowledge, and Intelligence (DKI) group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/data-knowledge-intelligence/), where I undertook independently a research project with the Microsoft Excel Team to enhance large language models' spreadsheet data handling via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT).

Throughout my journey, I have been driven by a deep curiosity and a desire to push the boundaries of NLP and AI. Pursuing a Ph.D. is the next step to immerse myself in an academic environment that fosters innovation and collaboration with leading minds.
